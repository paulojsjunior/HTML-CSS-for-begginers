# HTML-CSS-for-begginers
Here is my journey learning and practicing HTML and CSS.

From the beginning, I'll show you some project that I create along the course, and then I'll create my own projects using all acquired knowledge.

I hope it can be useful to check some tips of how to apply tags and other functions, as well register my learning along that journey.

Thank you so much :)
